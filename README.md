# Set-Card-Game
This project presents an implementation of the fast-paced multiplayer card game 'Set'. Developed in Java, this code underscores our comprehension of multi-threaded programming. Each player and the dealer are executed as autonomous threads, demonstrating our proficiency in managing concurrent operations.

Considerable focus has been placed on ensuring concurrent safety and correctness. Given the shared resources among different threads, attention was paid to employing a variety of techniques to handle potential concurrency issues effectively.
